- Use Context7 MCP only when unsure or dealing with version-sensitive APIs.
- Do not use MCPs for basic TS, refactors, or naming.
- Do not use `any`.
- JSDoc should explain intent and usage, not obvious code.
- Run `typecheck`/`lint` scripts when checking for errors and report any errors exactly as shown.
